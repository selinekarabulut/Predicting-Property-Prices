How Do Property Characteristics Influence Property Price? Multivariate Linear Regression with Higher order term

This analysis investigates how the listed price of properties depends on other variables such as property size,
age, distance to the city center, and distance to a toxic waste disposal site. Using a random sample of 83
properties for sale in a city, we compared several linear regression models. The best-fitting model suggests
that property size positively affects property price, and distance to toxic waste disposal site negatively affects
property price. Property age has a quadratic relationship with property size: for newer properties that are
less than around 15 years old, an increase in age increases property price; as property gets older, property
price decreases with age. Distance to city center did not significantly affect property price.
