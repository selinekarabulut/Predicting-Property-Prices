How Do Property Characteristics Influence Property Price? Multivariate Linear Regression with Higher order term

This analysis delves into the relationships between the listed prices of properties and various independent variables, including property size, age, proximity to the city center, and distance to a toxic waste disposal site. Utilizing a random sample comprising 83 properties available for sale in a given city, we conducted a comparison of multiple linear regression models.

Among the models considered, the most accurate one suggests the following:

Property size exhibits a positive correlation with property price, indicating that larger properties tend to command higher prices.
The distance to a toxic waste disposal site demonstrates a negative correlation with property price, implying that properties closer to such sites tend to have lower prices.
Property age exhibits a quadratic relationship with property price. For newer properties, less than approximately 15 years old, an increase in age leads to an increase in property price. However, as properties age beyond this threshold, their prices tend to decrease.
Interestingly, the distance to the city center did not show a statistically significant impact on property prices, suggesting that variations in proximity to the city center did not significantly influence property price variations in the studied dataset.
